## Data Sourcing:

Data was provided in the raw form and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somtoe/nigerian-presidential-election-results?select=2023elections.csv)
 
 
 
## Data Loading And Arrangement:

* The table structure was created before the raw file could be loaded into the database with the below command

>*2015 & 2019 Presidential Election Command*

|        2015     |     2019      |
|:----------------|:--------------:|
![](e2015.png)   |![](e2019.png)

* The data was loaded into the database from Server/PostgresSQL14/Databases/postgres/Schemas/Public/Tables/ then the 2 tables created namely election_2015 and election_2019.

* From each of the tables created right-click/Import/filename/locate the file/click the format option/select csv/ go to columns and uncheck other colums that are not present in the file/ then OK. At this point our file has been loaded to the database and it is ready for queries ðŸ™‚. However, lets have a look on the table information of the two(2) tables namely election_2015 & elections_2019
 
 
>*Table Information*

The 2 tables (election_2015 and election_2019) consist of Eleven(11) columns each

Let us have a look at how APC & PDP were able to gather votes on the average across the states and geopolitical zones in the country.

 &nbsp; 
>*What is the AVERAGE votes the 2 parties (Apc & Pdp) got in 2015 & 2019*

It was discovered that APC **(2015: *416890*, 2019: *410590*)** average votes were more than PDP **(2015: *347383*, 2019: *304405*)** average votes in 2015 & 2019 respectively. However, APC votes **fell** ðŸ”½ by 6300 votes in 2019 compare to their average votes in 2015 while PDP votes also **fell** ðŸ”½ by 42978 votes in 2019 compare to their average votes in 2015.


| Command Prompt    | Result     |
|:----------------  |:--------------:|
![](avg_vcmd.png)   |![](avg_votes.png)


Let us have a look at how the 2 parties were individually affected by the average votes.



 &nbsp;

>*How many states votes were won by APC above its average in 2015 & 2019 **(2015: *416890*, 2019: *410590*)** ?*



It appears that APC had **13** states out of the 37 cumulative number of states that were above the AVERAGE votes they got in 2015 and 2019.

>*How many state votes were won by PDP above its average in 2015 & 2019 **(2015: *347383*, 2019: *304405*)** ?*



It also appears that PDP had **9** states out of the 37 cumulative number of states votes that were above the AVERAGE votes they got in 2015 and 2019.


| Command Prompt    | Result     |
|:----------------  |:--------------:|
![](pdp_avgcmd.png)   |![](pdp_avgr.png)


Let us do a COMPARISON between the 2 parties, we would be looking at how many votes by states did one party had above the average votes gotten by the other party in 2015 and 2019.


 &nbsp; 

>*How many states votes WON by APC were ABOVE PDP average **(2015: *347383*, 2019: *304405*)** votes got in 2015 & 2019?*

| Command Prompt        | Result     |
|:----------------      |:--------------:|
![](pdp_apc_avgcmd.png) |![](pdp_apc_avgr.png)


At this point, we already have an understanding how the 2 parties were affected by the average votes they got individually and in comparison in 2015 and 2019. *Lets take it further to see the highest vote they got in 2015 & 2019 and how they were affected by it individually and in comparison*.


 &nbsp; 
 
>*What is the HIGHEST votes the 2 parties (Apc & Pdp) got in 2015 & 2019*

![](max_vcmd.png)   |![](max_vr.png)


Let us have a look at a comparison of how many states were WON by APC that were ABOVE pdp Highest votes in 2015 & 2019.


&nbsp; 
 
>*How many states votes were WON by APC above PDP **(2015: *1487075* , 2019: *649612*)** HIGHEST votes in 2015 and 2019*

In **2015**, Kano state was the only state with **1,903,999** votes for apc which were higher than pdp highest votes *1,487,075* in the country that year


| Command Prompt       | Result     |
|:----------------     |:--------------:|
![](apc_p2015_mc.png)  |![](apc_p2015_mr.png)


However,

In **2019**, "Kano"
"Katsina"
"Kaduna"
"Borno"
"Bauchi"
"Jigawa" states were the states won by apc above pdp highest votes *649,612* in the country that year


| Command Prompt       | Result     |
|:----------------     |:--------------:|
![](apc_p2019_mc.png)  |![](apc_p2019_mr.png)


*Hol up a sec, wouldnt it be nice to know which state delivered more votes for apc that were HIGHER than pdp highest in 2015 and 2019 respectively? Yea, you guessed right.* Kano did ðŸ™‚. Let me show you


| Command Prompt        | Result     |
|:----------------      |:--------------:|

 Kano delivered **1,903,999** votes in 2015 for apc (Higher than the most votes 1,487,075 pdp got in the same year) and still delivered **1,464,768** votes in 2019 for apc (Higher than the most votes 649,612 pdp got in the same year).

Okay enough for all the apc wins let us have a look at how pdp got more votes than apc highest in 2015 and 2019.


&nbsp; 
 
>*How many states votes were WON by PDP above APC **(2015: *1903999* , 2019: *1464768*)** HIGHEST votes in 2015 and 2019*

| Command Prompt        | Result     |
|:----------------      |:--------------:|
![](pdp_a2015.9_mc.png) |![](pdp_a2015.9_mr.png)


Okay that is that. Let me now show you the states WON by APC and the percentage difference compare to PDP number of votes from the same states during the 2015 and 2019 Presidential election


&nbsp; 
 
>*How many states were WON by APC against pdp in 2015 & 2019 Presidential Election and in what percentage?*

In **2015**, It was discovered that APC WON **21** states out of the 37 cumulative number of states during the presidential election with the HIGHEST percentage votes gap from BORNO state leading pdp in the state with *90%* votes and the least percentage votes gap was from ONDO state leading pdp with *9%* votes

|:----------------      |:--------------:|
![](apcp_p2019mc.png)   |![](apcp_p2019mr.png) 


And thats not all, I went further to check for the states WON by APC against pdp in both years and by their percentage (i.e states that apc won in 2015 and still won in 2019). However, It was discovered that **17** states out of the 37 cumulative number of states were WON by APC in 2015 & 2019 presidential election in the country.


| Command Prompt          | Result     |

|:----------------        |:--------------:|
![](pdp.a_2015_9_mc.png)   |![](pdp.a_2015_9_mr.png) 

Apparently, The total number of states WON by PDP in 2015 and 2019 were **14** states. This could also mean 14 states are loyal to PDP in the country ðŸ¤”. Let us have a view on how PDP and APC influenced the votes in the geopolitical zones in the country during the 2015 and 2019 presidential Election.


&nbsp; 
 
>*What is the Total Votes gotten by APC and PDP from the geopolitical zones in the country during the 2015 & 2019 Presidential election?*
