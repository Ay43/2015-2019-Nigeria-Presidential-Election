## Data Sourcing:

Data was provided in the raw form and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somtoe/nigerian-presidential-election-results?select=2023elections.csv)


## Data Loading And Arrangement:

* The table structure was created before the raw file could be loaded into the database with the below command

>*2015 & 2019 Presidential Election Command*

|        2015     |     2019      |
|:----------------|:--------------:|

* The data was loaded into the database from Server/PostgresSQL14/Databases/postgres/Schemas/Public/Tables/ then the 2 tables created namely election_2015 and election_2019.

* From each of the tables created right click/Import/filename/locate the file/click the format option/select csv/ go to columns and uncheck other colums that are not present in the file/ then OK. At this point our file has been loaded to the database and it is ready for queries 🙂. However, lets have a look on the table information of the two(2) tables namely election_2015 & elections_2019
